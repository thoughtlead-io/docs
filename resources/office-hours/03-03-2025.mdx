Join us weekly for **Office Hours** to discuss all things Thoughtly. [RSVP here](https://thoughtly.com/office-hours) to be notified about upcoming sessions.

#### Automation Agent Bug [00:01:25]

- A user reported an issue with automation agents not appearing in the dropdown for triggers and disappearing when selected.
- The problem is identified as being on the top of the bug list and is actively being worked on.
- An expected resolution for the issue is anticipated within the week.

#### Forwarding Calls and Billing Inquiry [00:03:00]

- A user tested Thoughtly's forwarding feature by purchasing a number and forwarding calls to a cell phone.
- It's confirmed that forwarding to a cell phone uses credits like a normal phone call.
- The user queried about SIP integrations for cost savings, which are in future plans though with no set timeline.

#### Google Integration Status [00:08:00]

- There is a delay in progress for Google integration with email and calendar due to Google's approval process.
- Office 365 integration is also planned for the future, but no specific timeline is provided.
- In the meantime, Zapier is suggested as a workaround for Google data integration.

#### Integration with External Data for Real Estate Inquiries [00:11:00]

- A user is developing a system to integrate a CSV file containing real estate property data for dynamic queries.
- The challenge lies in making sure that Thoughtly can navigate the CSV and return accurate property detail responses.
- Options considered involve using a webhook to pull CSV data during mid-call or other automation steps.

#### Variables and Automation [00:18:00]

- Inquiries were made regarding the documentation of variable usage within Thoughtly's automations.
- It is clarified that users can create custom variables for use in their workflows and automations.
- The concept of "Extract Fields" was highlighted as a powerful tool for variable management.

#### Version 2.0 Updates [00:19:30]

- Thoughtly's Version 2.0 is progressing as planned, and no delays are expected in the timeline.
- The update is highly anticipated among users who are looking forward to its new features and improvements.

#### Unexpected Automation Trigger Issue [00:20:30]

- An archived automation unexpectedly triggered, resulting in excessive text messages sent.
- The issue was identified as a fault where updates incorrectly re-triggered failed automations.
- A fix has already been implemented, and no further incidents should occur.

#### Mid-Call Actions and External Service Triggers [00:24:00]

- A user attempted to trigger actions during calls using webhooks to services like Make or Zapier but found challenges in receiving data back.
- It was advised to check webhook endpoints as potential sources for errors.
- A deeper examination into specific cases was recommended for resolution.

#### AI Voice Agent Bug During Call Initiation [00:30:00]

- An issue was reported where AI voice agents begin speaking before a call is fully connected.
- This problem affects demo reliability and user experience.
- The issue is acknowledged, though an update on its resolution was unavailable at the time.

#### Small Talk Feature Issue [00:32:00]

- Reports indicate the "small talk" feature in version 1.5 leads to premature call terminations if conversations deviate too much.
- Suggested to add instructions to prevent abrupt hang-ups.
- A ticket for addressing this behavior as a bug is planned.

#### Recommendations for New Users [00:34:00]

- For beginners, starting with Version 1 is recommended due to fewer constraints and more flexibility compared to Version 1.5.
- Transitioning to 1.5 can be considered once users are comfortable with basics and conversational aspects of Thoughtly.

#### Custom Voice Integration [00:36:00]

- Questions arose about integrating custom-created voices with Thoughtly, specifically through 11 Labs.
- Currently, only publicly available 11 Labs voices can be used.
- Requests for supporting custom voices should be submitted for future consideration.

#### Hosting and Server Infrastructure Discussions [01:39:00]

- Participants discussed various server hosting options including SSD Nodes, OVH, and Interserver.
- Interserver received praise for long-term customer support and reliability.
- The advantages of self-hosting using Proxmox for virtual machines and high availability were highlighted.
