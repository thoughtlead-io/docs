Join us weekly for **Office Hours** to discuss all things Thoughtly. [RSVP here](https://thoughtly.com/office-hours) to be notified about upcoming sessions.

#### Product Integration Updates [00:02:00]

- A new feature for integration with Calendarly was discussed, noting that it is back online and users can continue scheduling with questions.
- There are currently no scheduling API integrations, and updates to the interface may affect functionality.
- In V1.5, improvements in integration with GHL were mentioned, which provides the potential for enhanced actions related to scheduling on a GHL calendar.

#### Outbound Call Functionality [00:03:00]

- Issues with the immediacy of agent call connections were discussed, specifically how agents start speaking without delays.
- There is a need for a built-in delay to accommodate for initial greetings or responses to avoid missing the beginning of conversations.
- A potential feature enhancement includes a slider to adjust the speaking delay, improving usability when handling voicemails or when calls go directly to voicemail.

#### Development Roadmap and User Feedback [00:10:00]

- Feedback on the rigid pathway-focused nature of V1.5 was provided, with concerns about its impact on conversation fluidity and user adoption.
- A future V2 builder is in development, with anticipated features combining elements of V1 and V1.5, including enhanced action node functionality.
- The upcoming changes will cater to different needs with separate conversational models that allow seamless flow versus linear models with strict compliance adherence.

#### Car Dealership Use Case Inquiry [00:20:00]

- An attendee managing car dealerships expressed interest in implementing the system in a BDC setting for handling inbound communications and appointments.
- Suggestions included connecting with Thoughtly partners for assistance and considering potential pricing models for clients, outlining an arbitrage approach with managed service providers.

#### Automation and CRM Integration [00:35:00]

- Discussion on using automations to enhance functionality, with insights into creating contacts post-call rather than during the call.
- Recommendations for using extract fields in automations to capture call data efficiently and integrate with third-party CRMs such as HubSpot or Salesforce.
- It was acknowledged that Thoughtly CRM is currently basic, with plans for an overhaul in development.

#### Memory Functionality in Conversations [00:45:00]

- Explained options for adding memory-like features to agents, either using metadata during calls or utilizing third-party integrations for more complex memory management.
- Highlighted the ability to store call data and past interactions in GHL (Go High Level) or similar systems for enriched conversation history and better customer experience.

#### Usability and User Interface Feedback [00:50:00]

- Attendees provided feedback on difficulties with the usability of the 1.5 builder, particularly visibility issues when handling outcomes and nodes.
- Possible solutions include better outcome labeling methods and interface updates to enhance the user experience.
- The development team is considering a hover feature for outcomes to improve accessibility in the build process.

#### New Texting Feature and Caller ID Settings [01:05:00]

- Texting functionality was introduced, allowing interaction with agents via SMS, although currently limited in handling separate workflows for text and calls.
- There was a walkthrough of setting up verified caller IDs for phone numbers used in outbound communications, addressing user queries on potential verification setups.
- Exploration into the possibility of associating verified numbers with multiple agents for cohesive branding across communications.

#### Community and Support Opportunities [01:00:00]
