Join us weekly for **Office Hours** to discuss all things Thoughtly. [RSVP here](https://thoughtly.com/office-hours) to be notified about upcoming sessions.

#### Product Updates and Calendar Integration [00:00:15]

- A permanent weekly office hour schedule has been instituted to streamline attendee participation without the need for repeated registrations.
- Calendly has been reintegrated, which allows users to schedule and manage events more efficiently. There's continuous communication with Calendly for further API integration advancements.

#### Introducing Node-Based Objectives for GHL Integration [00:03:30]

- GHL's functionalities are expected to be enhanced with the V1.5 release. The integration will enable scheduling events directly from the workflow using nodes. This eliminates manual scheduling and improves automation.

#### Issue with Call Delays and Agent Start Time [00:06:30]

- There's an immediate initiation of speech once a call connects, leading to instances where half of the message is missed if the recipient doesn't answer promptly.
- Discussion on implementing a slider to introduce a delay before the agent starts speaking, potentially improving experiences with voicemail situations.

#### Upcoming Releases and Builder Feedback [00:13:00]

- Discussion on V1.5 being a more linear builder that follows a strict conversation pathway, suited for compliance-heavy environments, contrasting with V1.0's fluid conversational style.
- Announcement of a V2 builder combining actions with V1.0's features, allowing for more dynamic workflow creation in calls.

#### Pricing Strategy for Dealerships and Reseller Partnership [00:18:15]

- Introduction of a network of managed service providers to assist new users in setting up and utilizing Thoughtly, particularly in niche industries like car dealerships.
- Revenue models discussed, including fulfillment partners offering services for $1,500 to $2,000 with options for higher charges depending on added value.

#### Contact Management and Integration Challenges [00:24:45]

- Insights into creating contacts during and after calls, with processes involving automation setups post-call to refine CRM data.
- Addressed difficulties with actions during calls potentially affecting call adaptability and recommended automation steps instead, due to current CRM limitations.
  
#### Advanced Automations and API Utilization [00:33:00]

- Exploration of API optimizations for advanced automations, leveraging external CRMs like HubSpot, for efficient external integrations and automations.
- Introduction of using platforms like N8N for better data management and process optimization across different CRM scenarios.

#### Memory Functionality and Continuous Personalization [00:47:45]

- Creation of personalized engagements through metadata and variable usage, aiding in enhancing call engagements with defined memory scopes.
- Suggested workflows include dynamically updated memory parameters to incorporate call history and recent interactions.

#### User Interface Suggestions for Better Usability [00:54:00]

- Issues raised regarding node outcome visibility in V1.5, with potential solutions such as hover texts to enhance user experience during node management.

#### Texting and Call Workflow Division [01:02:30]

- Introduction to using texting mediums for agents, with a need for improvement on combining workflows without requiring separate agent setups for different communication forms.

#### Outbound Caller ID Management and Verification Process [01:08:45]

- Explanation of setting up caller IDs for outbound calls, allowing one number to be used across multiple agents via verification processes, enhancing control of brand representation.

Each topic was discussed with in-depth technical details, user suggestions, and future outlooks on product enhancements. The session provided valuable insights into advanced use cases, agent management, and integration possibilities with external systems.
