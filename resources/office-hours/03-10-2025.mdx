Join us weekly for **Office Hours** to discuss all things Thoughtly. [RSVP here](https://thoughtly.com/office-hours) to be notified about upcoming sessions.

#### Product Troubleshooting and Questions [00:00:00]

- A participant discussed issues with their Thoughtly setup, mentioning that their voice agent was hanging up prematurely. It was suggested that this might be due to how the agent is reaching an end node unexpectedly. Watching more instructional videos was suggested to resolve this issue.
- Another participant inquired about the pricing and structure of Thoughtly, asking if the cost is still 9 cents per minute and whether there are any additional fees. It was confirmed that this is still the case when paying annually on talk time.
- Discussion on automating SMS and voice calls, indicating Thoughtly's capacity to handle interactions seamlessly with both mediums through the same number.

#### New Version Launch [00:11:00]

- The new version of Thoughtly's agent builder, V1.8, was announced, merging conversational capabilities with the structured setup of V1.5. It was emphasized that user feedback on this release is needed to refine further improvements.
- The update is framed as game-changing due to its ability to handle conversational AI while maintaining structured workflows using "nodes."

#### White Label and Customization [00:22:00]

- A discussion revolved around the upcoming release of a white label platform. Challenges were brought up that in the interim involve customizations using other platforms, such as GoHigh Level, for agency development while Thoughtly prepares its own solution.
- Participants interested in building agencies or selling AI solutions are recommended to commence without waiting for the white-label feature, as the foundational product is available for agency use.

#### Agent Customization and Personas [01:00:00]

- The Thoughtly demo agents (including Tessa, John, and Ash) were highlighted as examples of how to customize AI personalities for different business needs. Emphasis was on Tessa's engaging conversational nature which was heavily driven by prompts designed to showcase Thoughtly's features.
- Plans to roll out a "persona builder" were discussed. This would allow users to define backgrounds, speaking styles, and other personality traits to apply to multiple agents.

#### Troubleshooting and Technical Support [01:40:00]

- Participants addressed technical challenges, such as agents talking before a call was picked up, and the need for more robust logging when integrating external data sources.
- A query about Thoughtly's capacity for concurrent calls was raised, with the assurance that concurrency isn't an internal limitation but might be limited by Twilio, the backend provider.

#### Community Support and Feedback [02:10:00]

- There was a call for establishing systems to reward community-driven support, enhancing user engagement to facilitate broader sharing of knowledge and troubleshooting.
- A suggestion was made to explore Discord or a similar community platform for more dynamic, real-time problem-solving and workshop-style collaboration among users.

#### Updates and Future Development [02:35:00]

- Discussion on how Thoughtly might manage new technological advancements such as real-time voice processing, signaling a shift in how voice and text AI might evolve and Thoughtly's adaptability to these changes was considered.
- Feedback mechanisms for improving product features, such as text messaging bugs and support for dynamic speech synthesis, were discussed, highlighting Thoughtlyâ€™s focus on continuous improvement.

#### Closing Remarks [03:00:00]

- Encouragements were shared about continuing to build and iterate on Thoughtly's capabilities as it progresses toward more sophisticated functionalities.
- Acknowledgment of ongoing challenges with certain aspects of product implementation and the emphasis on community feedback to inform product development was reiterated. 

This summary highlights key topics and takes note of direct troubleshooting actions discussed during the meeting, aimed at ensuring that those encountering similar issues in the future have reference points for possible solutions.
